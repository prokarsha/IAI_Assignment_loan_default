In the exploratory data analysis (EDA), the dataset was first inspected for structure and content, revealing various loan attributes and borrower demographics. Missing values were addressed through zero imputation, and unnecessary columns were dropped to streamline subsequent analyses. Categorical variables were transformed into dummy variables to facilitate modeling. Numerical features' distributions were visualized to gain insights into their characteristics and potential relationships. Furthermore, a correlation matrix heatmap was generated to assess pairwise relationships between variables, providing an initial understanding of their interdependencies.

Following the EDA, machine learning algorithms were applied to predict loan amounts based on the provided features. A Random Forest Regressor model was chosen for its ability to handle nonlinear relationships and interactions within the data. The model was trained on the dataset after feature scaling using StandardScaler to ensure consistent feature magnitudes. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) were utilized to assess model performance on both a held-out test set and through cross-validation. Through these processes, a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristics and predictive modeling capabilities was attained, facilitating informed decision-making in loan assessment and risk management.
